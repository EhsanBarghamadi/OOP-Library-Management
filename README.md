# 📚 OOP Library Management System

An advanced, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) based Reading Tracker developed in Python. This system allows users to manage their personal library of E-books and Audiobooks, track their reading/listening progress with visual progress bars, and secure their data with a robust authentication system.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login system with password validation.
- **Library Management:** Add, remove, and manage different types of media (E-books and Audiobooks).
- **Progress Tracking:** Visual representation of reading/listening progress using progress bars.
- **OOP Architecture:** Built with clean, maintainable code using Classes, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.
- **Modular Structure:** Separated concerns with `models`, `services`, `storage`, and `utils`.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `models/`: Contains the core classes (User, Book, EBook, Audiobook).
- `services/`: Logic for library operations and tracking.
- `storage/`: Handles data persistence (JSON/File-based).
- `utils/`: Helper functions and validation logic.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Data Format:** JSON (for data storage)
